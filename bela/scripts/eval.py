#How accurately does the system recognise unknown entity mentions (UEMs) vs. failing to link to an existing entity? Vs. erroneously flagging text spans that are not entity mentions at all?
#How accurately does the system recognise that two UEMs refer to the same UE?
#What UEs correspond to entities in EI2 - EI1?
#For detected UEs with a matching entity E* in EI2 - EI1, how close is the embedding generated by the UEDI to the embedding of E* in EI2?
#What is the accuracy of MDR1 using an index composed of E1 but extended with the newly detected UEs between t1 and t2?
